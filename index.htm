          <h1>Testimonials</h1>
          <ul class="testimonials"><li>[Dax] will tailor the interview to your specific skill level. . . . Once the interview is done, he will provide you with a google doc scoring you in different categories from 1-4 based on how well you did (rubric he pulled straight from Googleâ€™s hiring process).  He also provides written feedback . . .
          </li>
          <li>Out of the few mock interviews I have done thus far, my practice with Dax felt the most helpful. He asked targeted questions and shared insights, and my time with him gave me some overall takeaways of things I should think about going into the interview. Dax also is very personable, and you can tell he genuinely has your best interest in mind.
