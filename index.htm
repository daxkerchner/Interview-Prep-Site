          <h1>Testimonials</h1>
          <ul class="testimonials">
            <li>Out of the few mock interviews I have done thus far, my practice with Dax felt the most helpful. He asked targeted questions and shared insights, and my time with him gave me some overall takeaways of things I should think about going into the interview. Dax also is very personable, and you can tell he genuinely has your best interest in mind.<br>I look forward to doing more practice with him soon!

            <li>Dax was great! We did a mock technical interview together and he gave me excellent feedback on exactly where he thought I did well and actionable advice for improving where I could have done better. Would recommend!
            <div class="attr">— Marco</div></li>
            <li>[Dax] will tailor the interview to your specific skill level. . . . Once the interview is done, he will provide you with a google doc scoring you in different categories from 1-4 based on how well you did (rubric he pulled straight from Google’s hiring process).  He also provides written feedback . . .
