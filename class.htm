          <p><strong>This course will cover data structures and algorithms knowledge required to pass the interviews for most software jobs.</strong>  The pacing involves just a few hours a day, designed for people who are job searching at the same time.</p>
          <h2>Schedule<br>(Monday-Friday, two weeks total):</h2><ul>
            <li><strong>10:30am-11:30am ET:</strong> New material</li>
            <li><strong>11:30am-1:30pm ET:</strong> Working through LeetCode or similar problems with live help from me</li>

          <h2>This course is for you if:</h2><ul>
            <li>You know how to code but have not taken a Data Structures & Algorithms class</li>
            <li>You're not sure where to start with LeetCode problems</li>
            <li>You're not already familiar with most of the above concepts</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>This course is <em>not</em> for you if:</h2><ul>
            <li>You already have a strong grasp of data structures and algorithms / you find LeetCode problems easy<br>
              <em>— if that describes you, you should book mock interviews to practice problem-solving live in an interview instead.</em></li>
            <li>You are not yet familiar with a programming language<br>
              <em>— in that situation, you need to pursue the foundation first.  My course assumes students have taken the equivalent of programming classes or a coding bootcamp</em></li>
